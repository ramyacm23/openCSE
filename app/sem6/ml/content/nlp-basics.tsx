      <p className="p-text mb-4">
        NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding. Since machine learning models only understand numbers, text data must go through rigorous preprocessing and vectorization.

          <p className="text-xs">Splitting sentences into individual words or sub-words (tokens).</p>

          <p className="text-xs">Removing extremely common words (e.g., "the", "is", "at") that carry little semantic meaning.</p>

          <p className="text-xs">Chopping off prefixes/suffixes to get a root (e.g., "running" → "run"). Very fast but often creates non-words.</p>

          <p className="text-xs">Using a dictionary to safely reduce words to their base linguistic form (e.g., "better" → "good"). Slower but highly accurate.</p>

          <li><strong>Bag of Words (BoW) & TF-IDF:</strong> Sparse vectors representing exact word counts. Cannot capture context or word ordering.</li>
          <li><strong>Word2Vec / GloVe:</strong> Dense vectors (e.g., 300 dimensions). Understands that "King" is to "Queen" what "Man" is to "Woman". Captures deep semantic relationships.</li>

          Deep Dive: Attention and Transformers

          <p>Prior to 2017, NLP relied on RNNs and LSTMs which processed text sequentially (slow, and forgot early words in long paragraphs).</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>The Attention Mechanism:</strong> Allows a model to dynamically look at ALL words in a sentence simultaneously and weigh their importance when understanding a specific word. Example: In "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired", Attention helps the model know "it" refers to "animal", not "street".</li>
            <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> An architecture (introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need") that relies entirely on Attention, ditching RNNs. Highly parallelizable.</li>
            <li><strong>LLMs (Large Language Models):</strong> Models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) scale this architecture to hundreds of billions of parameters.</li>
